# Portfolio
# Description
    We were asked to make a simple three page website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
    The site needed to include a Home/About Me page, a Contact page, and a Portfolio Page.
    The site needed to include a NAV bar with working links as well as the content for each page.
# Contact Page
    Since the contact page was a single form element, I started the project here.
    I first added a Nav bar with links to the other pages.
    After doing this I added a container grid with a form inside. Inside the form I added the necessary contact criteria.
    In order to make the contact pop more I added a jumbotron on top of the form and removed the form heading.
    I added a sticky footer to the page and a background pattern
# Portfolio Page
    After completing the contact page I copied and pasted the code into the Portfolio and Index pages. This allowed me to insure that all three pages would have the same base code. I then altered elements as needed.
    For the portfolio page I added in Images that in the small screen size would take up 12 columns but in the large screen size would only take up 6. This allows the images to appear side by side when in the large screen mode.
# Index/About Me Page
    For the index page I added a thumbnail image and paragraphs for the About Me section. I added padding to the thumbnail so that the paragraphs would have some breathing room.
# Aids
    This project was done with help from Bootstrap and with research via W3Schools. Also, with image placeholders from placeholder.com
